## DIGITAL FRAMEWORKS, ASSIGNMENT 1

### STORY IDEA 1: Which U.S. city has reduced its gas emissions the most since the beginning of the pandemic?

There is no denying that the coronavirus pandemic has affected every business, person and aspect of life as we knew it before the
year began. Last year I did some coverage on Jane Fonda's "Fire Drill Fridays" protest series. As we approach Earth Day, I think it 
would be very interesting to see how, considering people have significantly reduced taking public transportation or driving to work, 
cities in the U.S. have reduced gas emissions and become "greener" during this time. There are various reports on how China and 
countries in Europe have already seen a decrease of gas emissions and helped conserve the planet. I would like to localize and contrast 
this trend to cities in the United States, and ultimately see what city has shown the most drastic change in gas/carbon emissions.

**Objective: Clarity and Accuracy**
- For me, given how to the point the headline was and tight the lede was, it was quite easy to follow the article and data visualization.
I would give it a 4.
  - The main goal of the first data graphic, which shows all global emissions since the 1850s, was to give an idea of how much 5% of the
emissions would compare to previous years and previous declines (like after the 2008 Recession.)
  - Yes.
  
- Because it was a written piece it was a little bit hard to follow the data and understand it, although the interviewees helped put it 
in context.I'd give it a 3 because other than the first graph there was no data visualization, which made it easier to understand the scope
of the story.
  - No, the most effective way to navigate the story would have been to have more graphs throughout the article.
  - If the graphs were interactive and allowed the reader to see in more detail how much the emissions drop compare with previous world 
  events, it would be easier to navigate and digest the story.
  
- I think the data was as accurate as possible considering it's an estimate. 5/5
   - I didn't question the data, although I questioned the decision not to publish where the data wwas picked from in the lede or in 
    the second paragraph.
   - They checked in with enough experts regarding the data, I believe.
   - Yes, although in the middle of the story.
   - Yes.
    
**Objective: Quality**
- I don't think this was done with great quality. I'd give it a 3, as the text is not quite clear and it lacks enough visualizations to aid
the audience understand fully the scope of the issue at hand.

- Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
  - While the graphic was helpful to put the emmissions in historical context, it didn't add anything of added value. More graphics should 
  have highlighted parts of the story to understand further. 


**Objective: Type and color if piece includes graphics**
- The graph was one single red line showing the increase of carbon emissions of fossil fuels over time, which was actually beneficial 
because it was very clear and easy to follow -- as you only had to look at one thing. It made a good job of differencing the actual data
from previous years and a dotted line to show the expected decline in 2020 -- 4/5
- I think there could be clearer ways to acknowledge what historic events the declines of emissions allude to instead of drawing lines 
from the graph itself, which makes it look crowded and unorganized even if only one matter is on display -- 2/5

**Objective: Creativity**
- I think the article as a whole fell on the notion that data stories are boring, as it didn't add anything to keep the audience engaged. 
The article could have, as I've said before, created more charts with comparisons of different countries, and animate them. 
  - Effectivenes of data visualization: 2/5


### STORY IDEA 2: What higher officials share the most accurate information regarding COVID-19?

I think this could be an interesting article that looks at what officials have the best track record in spreading truthful COVID-19 statements rather than spreading misinformation or theories with a flawed logic. An example of this that comes to mind is how Trump said African nations don't have more cases of coronavirus because many citizens have been using hydroxychloroquine for years. Actually, African nations haven't showed more cases due to the lack of testing resources available. I would choose around 10 or 15 high officials and compare their statements this year, as well as talking with experts about the risks of spreading misinformation during a pandemic.
