## Assignment 3: Create my own dataset
- I'm curious to see if Congress has passed more or less bills during election years. I think this could be interesting because many people
assume that because they may be risking their post, congressmen won't be prone to pass bills in case they lose their voters' support. 
A description of the question you're curious about, and an explanation about how this data could turn into a story. (Imagine this as your
justification to your editor as to why this is worth your time)
A list of the things you want to know about any data point
An explanation of how you'd go about collecting that data (you don't actually have to do it on an ongoing basis, especially if it involves
staking something out, just tell me how you would do it).
A table including at least five data points in this dataset
You can put your data in a google sheet (in which case, put the link in your markdown file) or make a table directly in the 
markdown document you submit like the example below.
